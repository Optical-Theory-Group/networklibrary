o. Fix the memory issue when finding the simple paths using multiprocessing
o. add_node and add_link methods have not been validated and tested for edge case scenarios [DONE]
o. in the detailed path finding in the network_path, it is not proper.
o. As of now, nodes are infinitely small spatial points, maybe try to account for that
o. When nodes are moved or added, the network links might start to criss-cross each other. This should not be possible. Add a method that checks
    if that is happening.
o. Add methods to remove nodes and links, also change existing connections


o. And more....I'm sure there is more.... I don't know what they are....I just know there is...
