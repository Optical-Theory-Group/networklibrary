o. Fix the memory issue when finding the simple paths using multiprocessing

o. As of now, nodes are infinitely small spatial points, maybe try to account for that

o. When nodes are moved or added, the network links might start to criss-cross each other. This should not be possible. Add a method that checks
    if that is happening.

o. Add methods to remove nodes and links, also change existing connections

o. Make the prepare_detailed_path_cache such that it can be used directly in naive_localization.py without extraction. maybe fill the rest of  the paths with NAN's so that vectorization is possible.

o. Account for the dispersive effects of the medium (Kind of Done)

o. generate linear networks and fix the voronoi networks

o. The interferometry file uses the amplitude of sample and reference beam as 1/sqrt. Make them variables

o. Implement the gpu code for interferometry that can be used for bigger networks. (Kind of Done)

o. Give the input measurement pairs required in the begining itself. So that we wont need to calculate the scattering matrices again.

o. Look at what find_peaks_cwt is seems to be better for Noisy Data.

o. Add a _spec_fingerprint code to different module, maybe add it to NetworkSpec and make a Cache folder in the Home directory
   and make it based on the SHA256 architechture.

o. I implemented the valid candidates from the intersection method such that I will consider the max matching 
    in all links. (should be a better way to do it, maybe look at the distribution and choose more than 90%)

o. Make a util function that plots a candidate on the network given the candidate

o. And more....I'm sure there is more.... I don't know what they are....I just know there is...

DONE SECTION
================================================================================================================================================
o. Make a function in the network module that when you give it a link and a ratio, it returns the spatial coordinate of that position.

o. The node_indices of links are saved as np.int32 while the indices of nodes are saved as int. Now, I fixed it by making converting any index
    link.node_indices to ints. (BWAAAAA.....I know its minor....fix it before something breaks | DOES IT NEED FIXING? BWAAAAAAA....I dont know)

o. The fault localizer does not do complexity checks. it should do BUT LATER WHEN VALIDATION CHECKS (redundant operation)

o. add_node and add_link methods have not been validated and tested for edge case scenarios

o. in the detailed path finding in the network_path, it is not proper.
